# OpenSearch Operator

A tightly scoped OpenSearch operator written in Ruby.

## Why a new operator?

Many issues with the [official operator](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-k8s-operator) triggered us to roll our own:

- Can't deploy opensearch versions beyond 2.12.0, released in February 2024: https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-k8s-operator/issues/759
- Certificate generation doesn't work, and even if it did work would only create a certificate with a 1 year TTL with no support for rotation
- No support for randomized automatic password generation (two pull requests exist but nothing's moving forward: [816](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-k8s-operator/pull/816), [986](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-k8s-operator/pull/986))
- Has a [huge number of bugs](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-k8s-operator/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Abug) and doesn't seem to have any momentum in fixing them
- Questionable security choices like making admin credentials readily available on disk on the opensearch pods
- Missing or outdated documentation
- Attempting to run the REST API without TLS doesn't work
- Doesn't follow best practices like capping JVM heap size to 31GB

We were also interested in writing a Kubernetes operator from scratch in Ruby and see how that would compare with orthodox Go operators as Ruby is the prefered language for the [Reclaim the Stack](https://reclaim-the-stack.com) platform. At the time of writing this operator comes in at ~1.5k lines of Ruby vs ~20k lines of Go (excluding tests) in the official operator.

## Features and limitations

Trying to become "feature complete" as a general purpose opensearch operator is outside the scope of this project. Having a limited and focused scope is necessary for us to ensure stability and maintainability over the long term. The main purpose of this operator is to suit deployments within the [Reclaim the Stack](https://reclaim-the-stack.com) platform.

That said, we ocassionaly go above and beyond the official OpenSearch operator (and even the official ElasticSearch operator) such as with our implementation of declarative snapshot management.

Notable features:
- Can deploy the latest versions of OpenSearch ü•≥
- Random passwords generated for all default users (`admin`, `kibanaserver`, `readall` etc)
- Ready to integrate with prometheus operator via a single `ServiceMonitor` and Grafana with a dashboard JSON template
- Fully declarative snapshot management
- Intelligent JVM heap management (50% of available RAM up to a cap of 31GB to avoid compressed oops)

Notable limitations:
- No functionality to create custom users and roles
- Not tested with old versions of OpenSearch prior to 3.x
- No support for "node pools" for advanced node role topologies (all replicas per cluster are expected to be homogenous master eligble data nodes)
- No support for single or two node clusters (same as the official operator)
- REST API runs without TLS (we assume clusters are either fully private or that SSL can be terminated at edge)
- TLS certificates for the transport layer are generated with a 100 year TTL, without strict host verification or rotation support

## Get started

- Deploy the operator: `kubectl apply -k deploy/`
- Create sample cluster: `kubectl apply -f examples/simple.yaml`
- Inspect: `kubectl get opensearch`

Look at the example files to understand the CRD structure.

TODO: add comprehensive documentation.

## Development

Prerequisites: Ruby 3.4.5

Install dependencies: `bundle install`
Run tests: `bundle exec rspec`
Build image: `docker build -t opensearch-operator-rb .`

### Local Run

For a faster feedback loop when testing changes to the operator you can run it from your local machine.

- Ensure `KUBECONFIG` is set (or default in `~/.kube/config`) and that the current context is the one you want to run the operator against.
- Run the operator with: `ruby lib/main.rb`

### Project Structure

- `lib`: operator code (entrypoint in `main.rb`)
- `examples/`: sample cluster resources
- `deploy/`: Operator Deployment and RBAC
- `spec/`: RSpec tests
- `templates/`: Templates used by the operator to create Kubernetes resources

## Container Image

Images are published to GHCR via CI.

- Base image: `ghcr.io/reclaim-the-stack/opensearch-operator`
- Tags: semver tags on releases (e.g., `v0.1.0` ‚Üí `:0.1.0`, `:0.1`), SHA tags for all pushes, `latest` on `master` branch.

Examples

- Pull latest master: `docker pull ghcr.io/reclaim-the-stack/opensearch-operator:latest`
- Pull a release: `docker pull ghcr.io/reclaim-the-stack/opensearch-operator:0.1.0`
- Pull a specific commit: `docker pull ghcr.io/reclaim-the-stack/opensearch-operator:sha-5ffbd47e74dc7bce2a57787f766f2846d2abae4a`
